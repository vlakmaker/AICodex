# 🧠 XuéCodex

*The Living Book of Learning* — a personal chronicle of my journey through artificial intelligence, experimentation, and applied creativity.

This codex contains daily reflections, project logs, skill assessments, and concept deep dives as I explore the evolving landscape of AI — not just as a user, but as a builder, learner, and strategist.

“学 (xué)” means *to study, to learn*. It reflects my commitment to continuous growth through hands-on experimentation and cross-disciplinary curiosity.

## 🧭 Purpose

XuéCodex is your evolving companion to:

- 📘 Learn fundamental AI concepts step by step  
- 🔧 Build hands-on projects to reinforce understanding  
- 🧪 Explore your own ideas, prompts, and experiments  
- 🧹 Stay organized while diving into courses, books, and tech

---

## 🗂️ Structure

The content is structured by **topic**, not by course or book, so you can reuse and remix ideas across different areas.  
Each `.md` or `.ipynb` file includes YAML frontmatter for easy parsing and publishing to a future Docusaurus site.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Markdown-first, portable structure  
✅ Concepts organized for cross-referencing  
✅ Built alongside courses like DeepLearning.AI  
✅ Compatible with Jupyter, GitHub Pages, or Docusaurus  
✅ 100% open-source and extensible

## 📚 How to Use

1. Browse folders by topic (AI fundamentals, ML, DL, Prompt Engineering…)  
2. Open `.md` or `.ipynb` files in VS Code, Jupyter, or Colab  
3. Remix and experiment freely  
4. Add your own notes using the same folder & frontmatter style

## 🛠️ Coming Soon

- 📘 Interactive site (Docusaurus)
- 📊 Visual mind maps and cheat sheets
- 🤖 Prompt engineering playgrounds
- 🧩 More example notebooks and mini-projects
