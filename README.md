# ü§ñ The AICodex

Welcome to **The AICodex** ‚Äî your open-source, structured knowledge base for mastering the world of AI. This is a personal learning project, organized by **topics** rather than by book or course, so that knowledge can grow, interconnect, and remain reusable across different resources.

## üß† Why Topic-Based?

Instead of organizing notes by course or book, **topics are the primary structure**. That means when multiple sources explain a concept (like "overfitting"), they all contribute to **one clear page**. This makes the Codex easier to search, maintain, and expand over time.
