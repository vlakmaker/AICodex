# ü§ñ The AICodex

Welcome to **The AICodex** ‚Äî your open-source, structured knowledge base for mastering the world of AI. This is a personal learning project, organized by **topics** rather than by book or course, so that knowledge can grow, interconnect, and remain reusable across different resources.

The AICodex covers core AI domains with concise, readable markdown pages that synthesize content from books, courses, and personal learning notes.

## üß† Why Topic-Based?

Instead of organizing notes by course or book, **topics are the primary structure**. That means when multiple sources explain a concept (like "overfitting"), they all contribute to **one clear page**. This makes the Codex easier to search, maintain, and expand over time.
