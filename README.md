# 🤖 AICodex

Welcome to **AICodex**, your open, personal knowledge base for mastering **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and more — one concept, experiment, and notebook at a time.

This project is built for *hands-on learners* who like to tinker, build, and understand by doing. It combines clear theory, working code, and useful resources — organized in a GitHub-friendly way.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

AICodex helps you:

- Learn **fundamental AI concepts** step by step.
- Build **hands-on projects** to reinforce understanding.
- Create your own **AI notebooks**, resources, and insights.
- Stay organized while exploring courses, books, and ideas.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

The content is structured by **topics**, not books or courses, to ensure that concepts are **reusable, connected, and scalable**.


Each concept or notebook contains a **YAML frontmatter** block so that it can easily be parsed and published to a Docusaurus knowledge site later.


---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Markdown-first, portable structure
- ✅ Topics organized for cross-referencing
- ✅ Built alongside courses like [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
- ✅ Fully open-source and extensible
- ✅ Compatible with Jupyter, GitHub Pages, or Docusaurus

---

## 📚 How to Use

1. Browse the folders based on what you're learning (AI fundamentals, ML, DL).
2. Open `.md` or `.ipynb` files in VS Code or Jupyter/Colab.
3. Learn, remix, and experiment!
4. Add your own notes and experiments using the folder conventions.
