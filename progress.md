# 📈 AI Learning Progress

This document tracks my day-to-day progress while building the **AICodex** knowledge base and learning AI through a mix of structured courses and hands-on experimentation.

## 🗓️ Week of March 25, 2025

### Monday
- ✅ Reorganized Notion export structure into GitHub-friendly folders (topic-first).
- ✅ Built a working Notion → Markdown pipeline.
- ✅ Created the new `AICodex` repository and initial file structure.
- ✅ Converted early notes (on ML foundations, limitations, classification vs regression) into Markdown.
- ✅ Set up README and clarified long-term purpose.

### Tuesday
- ✅ Completed "Logistic Regression as a Neural Network" in DeepLearning.AI.
- ✅ Created hands-on spam classifier mini-project.
- ✅ Organized notebooks under `playground/practice`, added CSVs under `playground/resources`.
- ✅ Added YAML frontmatter to topic Markdown files.
- ✅ Refined folder structure: topics split from playground, theory vs practice split added.
