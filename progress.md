# Log**

## 🗓️ Week of March 25, 2025

### Monday
- ✅ Reorganized Notion export structure into GitHub-friendly folders (topic-first).
- ✅ Built a working Notion → Markdown pipeline.
- ✅ Created the new `AICodex` repository and initial file structure.
- ✅ Converted early notes (on ML foundations, limitations, classification vs regression) into Markdown.
- ✅ Set up README and clarified long-term purpose.

### Tuesday
- ✅ Completed "Logistic Regression as a Neural Network" in DeepLearning.AI.
- ✅ Created hands-on spam classifier mini-project.
- ✅ Organized notebooks under `playground/practice`, added CSVs under `playground/resources`.
- ✅ Added YAML frontmatter to topic Markdown files.
- ✅ Refined folder structure: topics split from playground, theory vs practice split added.
- ✅ 🧠 DeepLearning.AI - Python for AI Developers. Completed: Lessons 1–6. 📝 Why I like it: Practical, not bloated, explains concepts clearly and at a nice pace.

---

## 📌 In Progress

- Continuing **Week 2** of the [DeepLearning.AI course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning).
- Continue with Lessons 7–10 this week
- Expanding theory and practice sections with visual guides and more notebooks.
- Planning Docusaurus integration for publishing.

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps

- Build a login system for MythosQuest.
- Explore prompt engineering and AI storytelling experiments.
- Add concept index and tags for cross-referencing.
- Write up blog reflections for Thursday.
